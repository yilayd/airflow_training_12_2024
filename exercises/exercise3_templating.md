## Exercise 3 - Use of templating

In the included code, build a DAG that:

- Echoes the current logical date (using the BashOperator)
- Fetches launch data from the launch library API (https://lldev.thespacedevs.com/2.3.0/launches) based on data interval 
- Prints the number of launches retrieved for that date

Partial implementations of the tasks are provided, focus on adding templating that executes tasks for the logical date.
